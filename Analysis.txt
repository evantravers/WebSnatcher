	While analyzing the requirements as given by Professor Warner, we quickly established some key use cases. Dr. Warner would be using this to save caches of websites that were about to disappear. The user should be able to give the program a simple URL, and receive a minimized copy of the whole site. The functional requirements are fairly simple. The user provides a URL to a command line program, and the program adds the website to a tree structure which optimizes file size by detecting components whose MD5 hashes are identical, and pointing to the existing stored copy instead of downloading a duplicate.
